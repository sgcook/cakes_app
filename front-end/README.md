# Welcome to Cakes App

## Next steps

If I had more time I would

- Add unit tests to the front end
- Add breakpoints for further responsiveness
- Add a delete functionality to delete cakes from the list
- Add authorization so only authorized users are allowed to add and view the cake list

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Did not have time to write any jest tests for the front-end.

### `npm run build`
