# Welcome to Cakes App

## Next steps

If I had more time I would

- Attempted to investigate the failing App.test.tsx but believe it has to do with using Chakra UI V3 in a React App. Never experienced this on lower versions of Chakra UI. Solutions would be either downgrade Chakra UI to V2 and rework components or potentially upgrade React to use Next.js or a different framework that has documentation support in ChakraUI V3. Did not realise until quite late as the App still renders and functions fine.
- Add unit tests to the front end
- Deploy the app to Netlify
- Update the environment variables when deploying to no longer execute on localhost
- Add breakpoints for further responsiveness
- Add a delete functionality to delete cakes from the list
- Add authorization so only authorized users are allowed to add and view the cake list
